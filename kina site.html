		<strong>About;</strong>
	</h2>
<p>
	Kina Awiiya Alternative Secondary is a special school, for those interested, or comfortable and used to, indigenous culture. It is not as strict, with a very accepting, and kind community.
At Kina Awiiya the curriculum is taught through booklets, which for some may be more difficult, but for others, it is the opposite. Unlike other schools, if you miss a day, you dont have to worry about missing something, your work will still be waiting for you, or for some classes you can bring it home to complete sometimes. The teachers are very helpful, the school is dclean, and offers lunch 3 days a week. Sometimes more. They offer everything needed to graduate, with some people being ablke to use life experiences as some of the credit that you can choose yourself, called PLAR, for me, this was very helpful, as I'm sure it was for many others.
</p>

<h2>What is different?</h2>

<p>
	Here at Kina, after you choose your classes, you aren't rushed like other schools, and can take as much time as you need on subjects that you may, or may not be great at, allowing you to not stress out as much, or worry about taking too long and the class moving on without you. So in this way, I would say the school caters more to your needs, than the class itself. So in my opinion, every student is cared for more, individually, if help, a break, or something to eat on lunch days is needed. There is usually someone there for you, willing to help you, give you time, something to eat on lunch days, or if you ask, something else

<p>
I find being a student at Kina to be less stressful than my previous school, because if I miss a couple days, or were to get sick, I come back to being on the same work I was on, and the class doesn't move on when I'm gone, because you could say, I'm in my <em>own class</em>, I could even bring most of the classes work to home with me! So, if you're motivated, you can get your credits as fast as you can comprehend, and do, your work. Along with the PLAR classes, usually for older students. That can help you earn the not required credits, the ones you can choose, using your life experience, like work hours, or being used to paying bills like rent or internet, and bring in a document showing proof of you having done it, proof required not because they dont believe you, but because otherwise anyone could just say they have and get them for nothing.
